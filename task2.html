        A paragraph is a series of sentences that are organized and coherent,
        and are all related to a <br>single topic. Almost every piece of writing you
        do that is longer than a few sentences should be <br> organized into
        paragraphs. This is because paragraphs show a reader where the
        subdivisions of <br>an essay begin and end, and thus help the reader see the
        organization of the essay and grasp its<br> main points. Paragraphs can
        contain many different kinds of information. A paragraph could<br> contain a
        series of brief examples or a single long illustration of a general
        point. It might<br> describe a place, character, or process; narrate a
        series of events; compare or contrast two or<br> more things; classify items
        into categories; or describe causes and effects. Regardless of the<br> kind
        of information they contain, all paragraphs share certain
        characteristics. One of the most,<br> important of these is a topic sentence.
